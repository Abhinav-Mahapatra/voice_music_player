# voice_music_player
A Voice controlled Music Player repo with a requirements.txt file.

Notes
The requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

The code contains no extra dependencies as it takes python defaults apart from this like re and webbrowser module.
